# Katana OSL Shaders
<img src="icon.png" width="320">

Blender-like OSL shaders for Renderman in Katana.

The PXR shading nodes are missing a lot of basic features, so I made these shaders inspired by Blender's node system.

These are designed to work for Renderman in Katana, so may not work correctly in other renderers.
